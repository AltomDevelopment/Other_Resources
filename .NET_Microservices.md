**TakeAways**
1. Microservices increase the performance and Scalability of the Application
2. Monolithic Applications have a bottleneck for performance as the app scales up 
3. With Microservices you can have a dot-net application for one service and a Java application for the other
4. You should chose Monolithic over Microservices for smaller applications


Have you ever come across a situation where you have to change something in production to implement a new feature that will effect thousands of users? 

**What are Microservices** 
Microservices, also known as microservice architecture, is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of smaller services. 
- Highly maintainable and Testable 
- Loosely Coupled 
Services connect with each other on a service endpoint, so no two services know any of the implementation detais about the other, or have any direct references.
- Organized Around Business Capabilities 
    - Instead of splitting an application into more minor services
    based on size, you decouple them based on the business problem.
    - Often patterns like the domain-driven design are used to identify the 
    business problem and seperate them. They're in their own domain logic, they're owned by a small team. 
    - This is why people often talk about implementing microservices, need a cultural change in the organization to every microservice is usually managed by independent teams that give the autonomy to decide when to release a feature or fix a bug with a weighting on the entire teams release.
- Independently Deployable 
Having a service model based on domain business, domain, autonomous teams, managing them and loosely coupled their package and deployed independently to understand this better. Let's look at how microservices are compared to monolithic applications.

**Architecture**
**Monolithic**
In the monolithic architecture even though the app is decomposed into multiple modules and fragmented into layers: 
- There's a user interface layer 
- There's a cache layer 
- There's a service layer 
- A data access layer 
- And the database itself. 

However, when they are ready for deployment, the package has a single deloyment unit, meaning they all are deployed at once with specific configurations and have create scripts and probably to a known infastructure. 
The critical thing to note about the monolithic architecture is that the modules are tightly coupled, Hence the feature roll-outs must have a specific release cadence that all teams must work together to prioritize for every release, increasing friction. 
Also in a monolithic architecture, you have a common database for all your modules are often the **bottleneck for performance** and implementing changes and scaling monolithic applications means often scaling VMs or the infastructure itself.

**Microservices**
- In microservice architecture, since the app is decomoposed into multiple independent smaller services that focuses on specific business functinality, they can be scaled inpendently on specific business functionality. 
- Every micro service is responsible for processing the data or external state in their respective databases. 
- Individual services can now decide if they want to use SQL or NoSQL database or any database of choice based on the business need. 
- Unlike the monolithic architecture, microservices do not share databases. That is a crucial benefit because the teams can now independly deploy applications into production multiple times a day, without breaking other services, microservices communicate with each other by using well-defined APIS. 
- Hence the internal implementation details of each service are hidden from the other services. It also supports polyglot programming. For example, microservices don't need to share the same technology stack libraries or frameworks. **So you can have a dot-net application for one service and a Java application for the other** and they all can run within the same infrastructure or entirely on their own. 
- As you rightly guessed, this kind of implementation is complex. Since the services are loosely coupled, the data will be duplicated. EPA calls needs to be resilent. 
- Maintenance will be complicated and you will need to invest in technologies that give you a holistic picture for logging and debugging and fiing box and that's why **Monolithic applications are still great for smaller teams and projects.** 
- You don't need to start writing microservices for every single project out there. 
- Remember that most applications that reference themselves as successful microservice implementation, started as monolithic. As a team size group they migrated to microservices. 

**How Microservices are Packaged and Deployed**
Even though docker containers and kubernetes are not a reuirement for microservices based applications. Most discussions around microservices involve talking about them. The reason about that is the significant benefit that you get with these cloud native technologies that help teams shift features to production foster.

**What Role Do Containers Play**
Containerization is an approach to software development in which an 
application or a service, its dependecies and its configuration are packaged together as a container image, just as the shipping containers allow goods to be transported by ship, train, or truck, regardless of the cargo insight software. Software containers act as a standard unit of software deployment that can contain different code and its dependencies. All the concept of containerization is more than a decade old. This technology has gained popularity since Dockers open-source implementation. Docker is an open source project automating applictions as portable. Self sufficent containers that can run on the cloud or on-premise. Docker is also a company that promotes and evolves in technology. Working in collaboration with cloud Linux and windows vendors, including Microsoft. When using Docker, a developer creates an app or service and packages it and its dependencies into a container image and image is a static representation of the app and its configuration and its dependencies. Its the image that when run becomes the container. Or in other words, the container is the in-memory. Its tense of an image in a typical scenario using darker, you package your app as an image and store it somewhere. I just need a container registry and when you want to run your app, you pull that image from the container registry, deploy to the host operating system and run them as container instance. For scalability, you can scale out quickly by creating new containers, and that is a crucial benefit for cloud native apps. Another benefit is that a container image is immutable. Once you have built an image, the image can be changed. The only way to change an image is to create a new image and replace it. This feature is our guarantee that the image we use in production is used the in development and QA as well. 

**How Does This Compare to VMs**
In a trditional Virtualized Environment, you will have the hardware, the host operating system hypervisor and the isolated virtual machines where the apps were runned. Most often there is a low utilization of resources and if you're hosting this on the cloud, chances are you're paying for some underutilized resources. So whenever there is an under utilization of resources, you can migrate containers to underutilized VMs for improved density, isolation, and cost savings containers are lightweight. You can spin up a container within seconds as compared to Williams, which will take longer to boot up, wether you're spinning up multiple containers to scale out or migrating continous to underutilized, VMs, to lower cost. You will need to do it in an automatic fashion and that's where the orchestrator comes into the picture. 

**What Is an Orchestrator**
Using Orchestrator for applications is essentally if your application is decomposed into multiple smaller services running in containers, in a microservice based approach, each microservice owns its model and data to be autonomous from a development and deployment point of view. This systems are complex to scale out and manage them. You need an orchestrator to have a producttion ready and scalable multi container application. Kubernetes has become the defacto standard for orchestrator. Its open source supported by the community widely used, and it is when the neutral you can run Kubernetes on a local computer all in the cloud on Azure. Now there's lot more that I want to share about Kubernetes, but ill keep that for another video. Enough of me talking lets go write some code.
